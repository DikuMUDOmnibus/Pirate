The nightgaunt~
A nightgaunt is standing here
~
...shocking and uncouth black thing with smooth, oily, skin, unpleasant horns
that curve inward toward each other, bat wings whose beating make no sound,
ugly prehensile paws, and a barbed tail that lashes disquietingly.  And worst
of all, it makes absolutely no sound or speach and smiles not at all because
it has no face, only a suggestive blackness where a face ought to be...

hunting horror~
The hunting horror~
The hunting horror is here in wait of an unwary traveler...
~
Serving Nyarlathotep, and now Roch'tar these beings are hunting for victims.
These beings resemble enormous ropy black serpents or worms possessing bat-
like or umbrella-like wings.  Their forms continually shift and change,
twitching and writhing, so it is hard to look at them.  They speak in great
harsh voices. A hunting horror is HUGE, normally around 40 feet long.

      He leers insanely at you ans says 'heh heh what can I do for you 
children?  Please dont mind my wife, she is always like that...hello
dear can you make some tea for our company? Oh good! Now sit right down
will you? would you like hot or cold tea? Yes the weather is....'

that are apparently not so solid now. He is carrying a leather satchel 
over the shoulder, into which he sometimes place some of the pieces. At
his belt hangs a strange, bluish whip
