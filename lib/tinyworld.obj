vacuum cleaner~
a handy-dandy vacuum cleaner~
One of those handy-dandy vacuum cleaners has been thoughtlessly left here.
~
Vacuum technology has apparently been pushed to its limit in this model. It
can suck up water, nails, bread crumbs, boiling acid, and most small animals
just from the power of a standard 110 Volt outlet. An unbelievable number of
attachments, for scrubbing, fur-cleaning, delousing, and such, stick out of
tiny comparments in the body of the vacuum.

	To Anyone,
	I have lost my birth control pills, and I will reward anyone who
	finds them.  Without them I will have many unwanted children.
	You should be able to find the keys (YES, KEYS) to the castle,
	since none of my servants fight for anything anymore, and one
	of them should be around the store room, where I lost it, so
	examine the area CAREFULLY since the dust is very thick there.
	But who cares about fighting?  I'm a lover, not a fighter.
	The last time I saw the other key was on a barrack dwarf.
  Signed, The Queen.
  PS When you find them, tell the Gods, and he will reward your hard
     work.  You must have all the keys necessary to obtain it, also.

   DO NOT ask a god.  There is a quest involved within here, and your
   first hint is that a dwarf in the barracks is your first clue.  He
   is not willing to share in the prize, so you may have to kill him
   for it.  When you complete the quest, you will be richly rewarded!
   Don't think that it is easy, because it is NOT.  Contact Depeche
